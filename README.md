# PhpStorm Commands for Laravel

You can use this repository as a submodule in your Laravel project if you are developing it via Jetbrains PhpStorm.

The purpose I prepare these files is I often use the command configuration of the PhpStorm as shortcuts, instead of typing commands. For example the Laravel artisan. I'm getting old, and I don't think it's necessary for me to remember all the artisan commands. And it's dangerous for me if I typed something wrong.
